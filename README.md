# CloudSuiteEnhancementToolkit
A variety of functions to make working with Delinea's Cloud Suite even easier.

There are two ways of working with the CloudSuiteEnhancementToolkit (CSET); the "Cloud Grab" method and a traditional download locally and run method.

# CloudSuiteEnhancementToolkit (Cloud Grab)
To get started, copy the snippet below and paste it directly into a PowerShell (Run-As Administrator not needed) window and run it. This effectively invokes every script from this GitHub repo directly as a web request and dot sources it into your current PowerShell session.

One benefit of this method is when updates/fixes/enhancements are made to the repo, a new Cloud Grab will obtain those changes without needing to compile and install a new PowerShell module. Effectively, this design makes this repo a "PowerShell Module as a Service".

```
$CloudSuiteEnhancementToolkit = ([ScriptBlock]::Create(((Invoke-WebRequest -Uri 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ajskrill/CloudSuiteEnhancementToolkitTEST/main/CloudSuiteEnhancementToolkit.ps1').Content))); . $CloudSuiteEnhancementToolkit
```

## CloudSuiteEnhancementToolkit (Local Grab)
If you want to run all of this locally, download all the scripts in this repo to a local folder, and run the primary script with the following:

```
. .\CloudSuiteEnhancementToolkit_local.ps1
```

# How to use

After using the Cloud Grab or Local Grab, you can see the list of cmdlets available within this module within the following snippet:

```
$CloudSuiteEnhancementToolkitScriptBlocks | Where {$_.Type -eq "Function"}
```

All functions have standard PowerShell help files associated with them. So you can use `Get-Help Connect-CloudSuiteTenant` to get the help file for that cmdlet.

First you need to connect to your tenant with `Connect-CloudSuiteTenant`. Here is an example:

```
Connect-CloudSuiteTenant -Url mytenant.my.centrify.net -User mycloudadmin@domain.com
```

*Federated Users* - a small popup will occur that will have you log into your Federated IdP. Once you complete authentication, the pop should close and you should be back in the PowerShell session.

*Non-Federated Users* - You will be prompted for a password and whatever MFA challenge is associated with that login.


## Once Connected

If you get output from the `Connect-CloudSuiteTenant` cmdlet, you're connected and will remain connected for however long your tenant allows you to stay connected. All further cmdlets using this module from this point forward will use your credentials as if you were logged into the GUI tenant.

Some cmdlets have additional methods with the custom class objects they return. For example `Get-CloudSuiteAccount` has additional methods such as `.getAccountEvents()` to obtain all events for this account within the past 365 days. See the help file for each cmdlet for more details.
